        <h1>About Manas</h1>
        
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Manas</strong>, and I‚Äôm currently a sophomore at <strong>Del Norte High School</strong>. I‚Äôm deeply passionate about <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>. These fields fascinate me because they combine logical problem-solving with creativity to build innovative solutions.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of school, I love mountain biking and street riding on my bikes <span class="bike-emoji">üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>. These hobbies have taught me valuable skills like problem-solving, quick thinking, and staying on my feet‚Äîboth literally and figuratively!</p>
        
        <p>I immigrated from India last year and joined Del Norte in my freshman year. Before that, I lived in the vibrant city of <strong>Bangalore, India</strong> for 13 years. The transition has been challenging but also incredibly rewarding as I‚Äôve adapted to life in California while staying connected to my roots.</p>

        <div class="fun-facts">
            Fun Fact: Did you know that Bangalore is often referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India" because of its booming tech industry? Now that I'm in California, I feel like I‚Äôve moved from one tech hub to another!
