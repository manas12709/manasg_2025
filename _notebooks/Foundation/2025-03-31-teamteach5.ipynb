    "There are several effective ways to protect intellectual property (IP). One common method is registering **trademarks**, which safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans that distinguish products or services in the marketplace. Another is registering **copyrights**, which protect original works of authorship such as books, music, films, software, and artwork, giving the creator exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work. **Patents** are used to protect inventions, processes, or designs that are new and useful, granting the inventor exclusive rights for a certain period. Additionally, **nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)** are legal contracts that help protect sensitive information by ensuring that individuals or companies keep proprietary details confidential. These tools are essential for securing the value and integrity of creative and innovative work."

It allows authors to specify how others can use their work — for example, whether it's okay to remix, share commercially, or only use with attribution.

    "###  Ways to Prevent Copyright Infringement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Original Content** – Always use your own work (writing, code, images, etc.) when possible.\n",
    "2. **Get Permission** – Ask for and obtain written permission or a license to use someone else's copyrighted material.\n",
    "3. **Use Public Domain Works** – Content in the public domain is free to use without restriction.\n",
    "4. **Use Creative Commons Licensed Content** – Follow the terms of the specific CC license (e.g., give credit, non-commercial use, etc.).\n",
    "5. **Cite Your Sources** – Give proper attribution when using someone else's work, especially in academic or creative projects.\n",
    "6. **Check Copyright Notices** – Look for terms of use or licenses on websites or platforms.\n",
    "7. **Use Royalty-Free or Licensed Media** – Only use music, images, or videos from royalty-free libraries or with purchased licenses.\n",
    "8. **Avoid Copy-Pasting from the Internet** – Don’t assume online content is free to use.\n",
    "9. **Use Fair Use Responsibly** – Only rely on fair use in cases like education, commentary, or parody—and even then, keep it limited and justifiable.\n",
    "10. **Include a Copyright Disclaimer** – Especially for content that involves third-party material under fair use.\n",
    "11. **Use Open-Source Software Correctly** – Follow the licensing terms (MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.) of any code you reuse.\n",
    "12. **Register Your Own Copyrights** – Protect your original works so others can’t misuse them either.\n",
    "13. **Educate Yourself and Your Team** – Understanding copyright laws helps avoid unintentional infringement.\n",
    "14. **Use NDAs and Contracts** – When collaborating or sharing sensitive creative content.\n",
    "15. **Avoid Using Trademarks/Logos Without Permission** – Even if it’s not copyright, trademark use has its own restrictions.\n",
