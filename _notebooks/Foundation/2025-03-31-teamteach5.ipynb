    "There are several effective ways to protect intellectual property (IP). One common method is registering **trademarks**, which safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans that distinguish products or services in the marketplace. Another is registering **copyrights**, which protect original works of authorship such as books, music, films, software, and artwork, giving the creator exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work. **Patents** are used to protect inventions, processes, or designs that are new and useful, granting the inventor exclusive rights for a certain period. Additionally, **nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)** are legal contracts that help protect sensitive information by ensuring that individuals or companies keep proprietary details confidential. These tools are essential for securing the value and integrity of creative and innovative work."

It allows authors to specify how others can use their work — for example, whether it's okay to remix, share commercially, or only use with attribution.
