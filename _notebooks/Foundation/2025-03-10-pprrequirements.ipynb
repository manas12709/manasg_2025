    "3. **Generating a Question**: Once a valid topic is selected, the function calls `sendToGeminiAPI(selectedTopic)`, passing the selected topic as an argument. This API call uses the topic data to generate a relevant question.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Displaying the Question**: After receiving the generated question from the API, the function updates the `questionBox` element to display the question to the user. This process demonstrates how the data from the list directly influences the application's functionality, allowing users to interactively generate questions based on their interests."
