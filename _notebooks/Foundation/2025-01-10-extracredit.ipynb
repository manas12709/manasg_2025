    "        College interview advice for computer science and engineering majors emphasizes the importance of technical understanding, project-based learning, and effective communication. David Vasilev from Purdue highlights the value of thoroughly understanding your code for live reviews, using flowcharts for project planning, and maintaining clear documentation like GitBooks. He also advises leveraging career fairs, internships (even unrelated to your major), and networking through LinkedIn or campus events. Michael Hayes from SDSU stresses outlining your work, summarizing ideas clearly, and using use-case diagrams to communicate effectively. Vivian Ni from Columbia suggests creating portfolios on GitHub or personal websites to showcase projects and using repositories for group collaboration. She also emphasizes gaining skills from extracurriculars, such as using Arduino and laser cutters. Edwin Abraham from Purdue recommends focusing on your majorâ€™s strengths, joining clubs aligned with your passions, and applying strategies like agile methodology for better collaboration. Across the board, the advice underscores preparation, communication, and leveraging both academic and extracurricular opportunities to stand out.\n",
